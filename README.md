# Quantum Project: Ball-State Circuits with Qiskit

In this project, you will work with Qiskit to explore and implement various Ball-State circuits. Ball-State is a specific representation of qubits on the Q-sphere.
 Your goal is to create circuits for different Ball-State cases and visualize them on the Q-sphere.


## Task : Building Ball-State Circuits

In this task, you will create Qiskit circuits for various Ball-State cases.

### Cases to Implement:
1. Case 1: |00⟩+|11⟩ 
2. Case 2: |00⟩−|11⟩
3. Case 3: |01⟩+|10⟩
4. Case 4: |01⟩−|10⟩

### Steps:
1. Set up your Python environment with Qiskit and import the necessary libraries.
2. For each of the Ball-State cases listed above, create a separate Qiskit circuit.
3. Use appropriate gates and rotations to prepare the desired Ball-State for each circuit.
4. Add measurements to the circuit to observe the final state.
5. Use Qiskit's visualization tools to display the Q-sphere for each of the circuits created


Ensure to organize your project neatly and provide clear explanations of your work at each step. Use code comments to explain the purpose of each part of the code. The report should be well-structured and easy to follow, including relevant figures and diagrams where necessary. Good luck with your Ball-State exploration using Qiskit!
